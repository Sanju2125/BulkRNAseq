# BulkRNAseq
RNA-seq analysis of breast cancer samples

# RNA-seq Analysis Pipeline

## Overview
This repository contains scripts and metadata for RNA-seq analysis using:

- HISAT2 (alignment)
- StringTie (reference-guided transcriptome assembly)
- featureCounts (gene-level quantification)
- DESeq2 (differential expression)

## Dataset
- Organism: Homo sapiens
- Reference: GRCh38 (GENCODE v44)
- SRA accessions: SRR1027171 – SRR1027190

> Raw sequencing data (FASTQ/BAM/SRA) are **not included** due to size constraints.
